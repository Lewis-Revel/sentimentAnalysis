,,,"This should have 5k upvotes by the morning. This  game mode should be a 99v1 In a sense . This is nothing but Solo with Thanos, which is stupid. ",,
,,,[deleted],,
,,,anyone else wish he had like 30k health and everyone worked together to kill him? ,,
,,,"Honestly this game mode would be better in squads. Whoever gets the Gauntlet is put into their own squad. Buff his stats.


Make the squads feel like Avengers. Give Thanos more stone powers. ",,
,,,"I was actually kind of disappointed with the mode. It fills like you versus 98 others and Thanos. So it is like Thanos has 98 teammates. Say you are shooting at Thanos well guess some guy sees you as an easy kill so bam now your dead and Thanos now has one less person to worry about. 

I predict as time goes on even with the nerf Thanos will still win more than he loses. Players aren’t going to go for Thanos when they can get a sure kill for the guy that is. When I have been a match I can’t be bothered with Thanos because I have to worry about the 3 to 5 people I see before I get to him. 

What I would like to see is a solo queue with squads. You won’t really care about your squad mates because they are randoms but they will be someone who won’t kill you and may work together. If one becomes Thanos then they are no longer in the squad. Or 99 vs Thanos make everyone teammates give Thanos a shit ton of health and damage and see who comes out on top. ",,
,,,"Offensive how weak they made him. Did they even see the movie? He should have 1,000,000 HP and the gamemode should be 99v1.

Also, why the fuck does he use the Time stone when he punches? Or the Mind stone when he jumps? That makes no sense, EPIC. 

Wouldn't it have been cool if you could do something specific with every stone?

Time stone - use this stone and get taken back to where you were 30 seconds ago. Cooldown of 5 minutes.

Reality stone - use this stone and fuck with your enemy's screen (your enemy starts seeing hallucinations) Cooldown of 5 minutes.

Space stone - use this stone to teleport to anywhere on the map. Cooldown of 5 minutes.

Soul stone - use this stone, and the soul of the next enemy you kill could be absorbed into the stone. At any time you want, you could release the soul, and the player you killed (only if he hasn't left the game, otherwise any one of the people you killed still spectating you can come back) comes back as a ghost and can run around in ghost form. He'll be just like a normal player, but he can't damage you nor win the game with you. One time use. (any suggestions for this would be nice, as I think it's too similar to the Mind stone.)

Mind stone - use this on a player and he joins your team, and can win the game with you. One time use.

And for power we obviously already have it being used properly (power energy beam), so no need for a suggestion.",,
,,,"Keep in mind if you buff him for the intention of a 99v1, say he dies when 30 people are left.  Now the guy with the gauntlet is a boss meant for that many people, not 30, he’ll just have a field day",,
,,,"Or, even better, Thanos should be super OP and it should be everyone vs. him. The person who ~~gets the kill~~ does the most damage to Thanos (credit to /u/bananasampam for this idea) is immediately turned into Thanos. Players can also only be killed by Thanos, making the gamemode a true boss fight. Since it's everyone vs him, Thanos could gain the teleport ability as well as the ability to drop everyone's health in a small radius around him to half its original state.

Edit 1: A word and punctuation

Edit 2: To elaborate on the other abilities, I think that Thanos should be able to just disappear into a blue portal like he does in the movies (using the space stone or otherwise) and show up at a random location anywhere within the circle. This would allow people to have more mobility, without the charge-up required for the jump, while still not making him ""too over powered"" (even though he should be, since he's Thanos). As for the other one, Thanos should be able to use the stones in tandem to drain health from people within firing range around him. This would allow people to last longer as Thanos, as he is easily defeated with a scar from long distance (this move should have a cooldown). Finally, I also think he should have a shield or protective move that would prevent him from dying so quickly. 

Edit 3: Changed wording. Also, the Thanos should be chosen at random as soon as everyone is on the ground. One person randomly transforms into Thanos and the voice of Thanos echoes out across the map ""A new successor has been chosen"" or something similarly ominous. This would also happen every time he dies, except the new successor would be the person who did the most damage to the old Thanos!

Edit 4: Thanos gains the ability to put up a protective shield around him using the reality stone, turning all incoming bullets, rockets, or other harmful objects into harmless bubbles. Credit for this idea goes to /u/-Mr_Rogers_II!",,
,,,"I think they should remove immobilisation timeand make everything more powerfull, but add cooldowns to powers.",,
,,,Maybe add him shielding himself as a defensive move. Blocks and percent of shots going towards him,,
,,,"yea, honestly, every time I see someone get it, I see them get wrecked... He honestly seems like more of a moving target practice than a threat.",,
,,,You should be able to cancel the jump too.,,
,,,"Not only should Thanos be more powerful \(as in your original post\), I believe it should also be a 99V1 by game's force, rather than letting the players attempt to team.",,
,,,Epic needs some changes and this mode could turn very good. Right now they’re on the edge of ruining it or making it amazing. ,,
,,,a simple fix would make him have 800/800 and anytime thanos is on the map players cant do damage to each other but the second thanos dies its back to a free for all until someone becomes thanos again,,
,,,You can easily 1v1 Thanos with a good AR. Just blast him as he charges his jump!,,
,,,"Also the the mind/soul stone should show everyone on the map. There is no hiding from thanos, only preparing for him.",,
,,,"To add to this, they really need to make it so you MUST have at least 1 weapon in your inventory in order to pick up the gauntlet.

This game mode shouldn't be about waiting in the air on your glider, looking for the gauntlet to land.

If a weapon is required, everyone will have to land and fight to get the gauntlet. As it should be.",,
,,,"Yeah, Epic definitely fucked up nerfing him so fast. Why take a LTM so seriously anyway? Let people have fun.",,
,,,They should make it so the 99 players are in a team because you know very well that you’ll never having people teaming up in a solo scenario they’d rather just kill each other.,,
,,,"https://clips.twitch.tv/CourageousCharmingHummingbirdWoofer

I do around 137 with laser.  He does 473 dmg in one Scar mag.. like get the fuck out of here.  How does the Gauntlet do less dmg than a Human gun.  Get fucked.",,
,,,The mode in general sucks. Good for maybe a couple games ,,
,,,Shhhh. Keep it the way it is. I've been missing blitz and this is basically solo blitz. I love the constant action haha. ,,
,,,"50 v 50 with 2 Thanos spans on both sides of the map, team knows where span is so they can protect him, if team Thanos dies, can be picked up, by either team. ",,
,,,I feel like people use Thanos’ laser wrong. They either get really close to the enemy and shoot it (dumb) or jump high as fuck and shoot it in mid air (dumber). Use it to kill off or hurt people that are bothering you when you’re chasing someone else. You don’t even have to damage them. Seeing a purple laser come at them will most likely activate the John wick mode in them.,,
,,,"Everything you said was spot on..... except that under no circumstances will solo players ever work together, no matter how strong Thanos gets, which is why he had too be nerfed. An imperfect solution to an imperfect problem. ",,
,,,"Have you considered that maybe the reason they have him at the weakness he is now is so everyone can have the chance to play as him? While I do like the idea of him being more powerful, it's not exactly fair to the people who will probably never get a chance to play as him with that level of strength.",,
,,,"Thanos was only good on 1vs1, even when he has 300 sheild pre-nerf. If 2 or more good player team up on him, he is pretty much screwed.

My suggestion: 

- Super Jump: Shorter charge time

- Power beam: Thanos could stop using the beam whether he wants.

- (4th ability) Reality stone's attack nullifier: Thanos nullifier all attacks toward him, making him invincible. Thanos cannot do anything but walk in this state.",,
,,,"I just played as Thanos the entire game and won with 16 kills. You're probably just doing it wrong, I don't think a buff is a good idea. He's really strong if you play it properly. ",,
,,,He is definitely too weak. I 1v1d a full health Thanos and won on my 2nd game who the LTM.,,
,,,Yes! People need to work together to kill him.,,
,,,Epic took the L on this one,,
,,,"I basically just avoid being Thanos until top 10. Anyone who picks it up earlier is basically just guaranteed to die. Granted, a lot of people still don't really know how to play as him, but the chargetime to jump is just way to long.",,
,,,"I agree, but in the grand scheme of things this mode is for the kiddos. Epic wants the kids to able to play as Thanos. At least it takes skill to survive as a Thanos.",,
,,,"Exluding specifics on his powers, it would make sense to buff Thanos, but also slightly adjust how the game flows.

Instead of the drop coming in at the 1:50~ time on the clock, it should drop when there are 50 players remaining. Once someone becomes Thanos, the remaining players all are flipped to be on the same team. You have a 50/50 shot at winning, while the player pool should be spread out due to looting/surviving to get into the final 50, and helps reduce the number of players just floating until they can drop right onto the Thanos powerup.

TLDR: First half of the game is standard solos, Second half ""Juggernaut"" style game mode.",,
,,,What if they buff thanos then make guns do half damage to players but regular damage against thanos. ,,
,,,Maybe you just suck as him,,
,,,Agreed,,
,,,He's so easy to kill. My only threat are other players,,
,,,Tweet this to them guys,,
,,,"Would be nice if it was ALL vs Thanos fighting a MEGA OP Thanos as an actual challenge. Once someone gets the gauntlet it's no longer solo mode but all vs Thanos, when Thanos dies it's Solo mode again as everyone kills eachother for the gauntlet. ",,
,,,I agree he needs to be perfectly balanced as all things should be ,,
,,,Just allow him to run like a normal person instead of relying on jumps to move lol,,
,,,"I just saw ninja get 20 kills with thanos for the w.


Then again it's ninja. ",,
,,,"Its alright as it is, if you get with less than 20 people left, you can usually do well. Any earlier and you get lasered by like 5 guys at once and drop almost immediately. The jump needs to be way faster or at least be able to be canceled, the laser should do way more damage, it should have been kept at 15 or buffed to 18 or something, and maybe have some way for Thanos to fight many at once, atm he can only really do well 1v1. Maybe a simple one would be a time stone ability where everyone near him is slowed to %50 speed and shoots at half the speed? Or a reality stone ability where he becomes invisble or cloaked for a little bit? I think its a fantastic idea by Epic and even as it is its super fun, but I think Thanos should feel more powerful than he does now.",,
,,,"It sounds like most people want to just be Thanos and win to me. Now I’ve only played two rounds of Infinity Gauntlet with my first being death by other player and my second being a well thought out and hard fought victory against Thanos. He didn’t seem weak but had clear venerabilities that didn’t make him unbeatable. What’s the fun in that? Oh you’re the last one with the gauntlet so you just win? There’s no point in working together just to be screwed over, it’s just be Thanos if you WANT  to solo and that’s it. He’s a added factor, not a game ended...which would be generally horrible. ",,
,,,"I don't understand why it's solo only. Would make more sense if it were squads as they would actually work together to defeat him. Or have a squad mode where instead of becoming Thanos, the squad becomes the Black Order. Really missed out on a great opportunity.",,
,,,"I started playing Fortnite about 2 Weeks ago, having gathered ONE Win ( and it was actually Team-Mode, not solo). Yesterday i started playing the Thanos Mode and gathered 4 Epic Wins in 6 Games.


Dunno if this is a coincident. Just used a pretty sneaky tactic all the time. Due to the increased quality spawns i was able to use the Bush-Item to sneak into the final zone each time. Just place yourself at a natural location and dont move your cursor, and enemies likely wont notice you. In the end - when its basically Thanos vs. you - just wait until he lands after a power charge and then keep spamming your SCAR (and i promise you, youll get one in this mode) on his head. Hes dead after 3-4 seconds.",,
,,,"My biggest frustration with the game mode is other players. I barely even get to fight Thanos.  I'll be 300m away from the next closest player and Thanos could be right next to them yet the turn around and shoot me despite the fact that I haven't even gotten close to them. I figured if Thanos is ""such a threat"" other people will be just as concerned with killing him as I am. Apparently me with a green pump is super threatening from a football field away. Also, didn't I read here that the loot was supposed to be Rare, Epic, and Legendary only? Because I was seeing uncommon and commons all over the place. Maybe I read that wrong.",,
,,,"I don’t know. If you play with him properly then he is incredible. I just played a game, was second to get the gauntlet got 23 eliminations and I won. 

Think people are just charging around with him assuming he is completely invulnerable. But if you jump from cover and I se the laser at close range he is pretty unstoppable. ",,
,,,"Honestly this isn’t a good idea.
If you make Thanos too powerful to the point where you *need* 20 people taking him on at once, then what happens when he dies and someone grabs the gauntlet with ~5 players left? That person just gets an instant win. I think most people like the fact that if you play smart, you can take Thanos on by himself.

I’m seeing all these “99v1” posts and that would be a *terrible* idea for a game mode. As the person playing Thanos, you’re either gonna get destroyed by a mob of players in the early game, or absolutely crush the rest of the remaining players since there aren’t enough of them to take you on anymore in the late game. There would be no in-between. 

Thanos needs to be strong enough to be a threat, but not enough to the point where you can’t kill him alone. I get that it’s an injustice to his movie portrayal but fighting someone who can insta-kill half the map as he so pleases doesn’t make for a fun video game.",,
,,,"Bruh it was the last 6 last night, I start beating the shit out of thanos and he only had about 20-40 health left and some dude who I spared shoots me in the back. ",,
,,,"YES YES YES YES!
What I wish it was, is where one player is thanos. Then, all other players are split into 6 groups. The infintity stones are in the locations, being guarded by the teams. Thanos's goal is to take the stones from each location, and pass through the defenses. If he gets a stone, he gets more powerful, and if he gets all of them he (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER) snaps his fingers and kills half of the remaining players. Then, the rest gang up on him, to try and win it. That's my idea, but they went with this ... shit. This was shit, no way around it.
",,
,,,Agreed!,,
,,,No LTM should be for stats.,,
,,,"Totally agree. Every time I play that mode, I’m wishing that I could work together with the other players against Thanos.",,
,,,"Also, add more powers for each stone that he possesses. For example, weird reality bending. ",,
,,,I think another huge issue is the that this game type drops better weapons than normal solo. I got three scars just from chests last game,,
,,,A dumb Thanos is very easy to kill,,
,,,you should only be able to play as Thanos if you've won a battle royale where you killed exactly 50 players,,
,,,"The fact that Thanos is so weak while everyone on the map can see where he is is laughable. Either remove the map marker or make Thanos stronger. Epic is trying to balance him around 1v1 situations even though the entire server is on your ass at all times.  
  
At that point is make it 1vs99 and buff Thanos to hell.",,
,,,Squads of 20. Each one has the current version of Thanos.,,
,,,"I just won a Thanos game by hiding the entire time, sniping those who sniped Thanos, and then killing the last person, who was Thanos. ( The 3rd person left brought Thanos down to about 150 health, I sniped Thanos for 100ish damage, then I finished him with the scar ) I think Thanos is balanced, he keeps players from building bases, and he is easy to play, hard to master.",,
,,,"I never even got Thanos yesterday because I did challenges in that mode but it turns out other people had that idea also “open chests at greasy grove” I went into the gauntlet gamemode and Greasy was out of zone, 8 people landed there I got 6 of them.",,
,,,"I don’t know, I’ve won every match that I’ve gotten Thanos in the top 15. You just have to play him right, use structures and bases to time your attacks perfect. He shouldn’t be unkillable, I solo’d Thanos with a well executed RustLord style plan including Boogie Bombs, RPG’s and. Gold Scar. He never stood a chance against my Awesome Mix Volume 3. I then wrecked the remaining 6 players as Thanos, only taking damage from the Storm. He needs to be able to be 1v1 for the last 2 in the match. ",,
,,,"If he is OP, they need to remove the win stats. I like that in the current ‘nerfed’ state, you can still easily beat the playing field if played right, but you have to be really careful, especially to not get caught in the open",,
,,,"11 kills as Thanos, they just kept coming 1 at a time no one came as a team, they all kept killing each other. Got down to 1 v 1 and a guy who had literally been hiding in the bush killed me as I had 6HP left and no shield regen on the last boss. kinda all over the place ",,
,,,So whoever gets him first has a massive advantage? The reason I'm still playing is because of a chance of killing him and becoming him. People aren't playing together it's one man for himself plus Thanos. If people actually teamed up against him id be happy him being stronger. The game mode works as it is. I trust Epic on this one. ,,
,,,I think that he’s really powerful but you just have to use him strategically... I’ve been able to kill Thanks multiple times because he’s started to jump in front of me so what I learned to do is only jump if you’ve got distance to cover or if you are under cover. I won with over 10 kills by only jumping when I had to and being super aggressive with punching (as the power stone ability slows you down and makes you immobile). ,,
,,,"I don't really agree with this, you have to adopt a certain play style while as thanos to be effective, I used thanos once pre nerf and got third with 12 kills (my first time as him so I wasn't that good) then I've had him twice since nerf and won both games with 18 and 19 kills (I got thanos at the very beginning all times)(I'm not bragging I'm just trying to express that he is very good in his current state). in my opinion his laser really doesn't need a buff as it is still really powerful after nerf and I don't think a defensive ability is necessary as it's effective to just hit and run in a sense. Using this and staying on high ground till I saw someone, I would then go kill them and come back to the high ground to look out for more people, doing this I managed to get 19 kills and still have 600 out of 800 health left at the end of the game. So ye I think he is powerful enough as he is, you just need to use a different play style and mindset than you normally would. Also get behind cover before you charge you jump.",,
,,,"He's nowhere near as bad as most of you are making it sound. There are different skills and tactics that work well with him that are completely different to normal Fortnite. 
He's similar to the Heroes or Villains in Star Wars: Battlefront. 
All this being said I do agree that the nerf was harsh. Best I've managed with him post-nerf is 7 kills and Top 10 finish whereas pre-nerf I was getting 15+ kills and winning relatively easily.",,
,,,Last night I would have agreed more strongly even when I got 3 wins in a couple hours as thanos but now people seem to be realising to actually use his punch and so the moment I go to engage thanos even at half health he ground slams and spams punch to catch me. So I think people are learning.,,
,,,He should be able able to use the reality stone to create walls and what not etc.,,
,,,"100% agreement. The best experiences I've had with this format have been where I come across a dude, Thanos is over the ridge, and we try to take him on. But that only happens once out of 20 or so games, and the rest of the time it's just fighting against Thanos while bush-wookies snipe the people fighting Thanos. Isn't the entire point of this to get that feeling of back-stabbing jackals pushed into fighting together to take on an apocalyptic threat instead of ""huehue, I'll snipe the dude fighting Thanos lmao.""",,
,,,"I really like it, Thanos requires some skill and has a learning curve.",,
,,,">He should be OP enough to where players will work together to kill him, instead of hunting each other, because they know there is no other way to defeat him

They still won't. ",,
,,,"I would like to see a squad version of this event, and it would make sense to buff him in a squad event seeing how people can team up on him. I never play solo unless im doing a challenge or there's no one on...",,
,,,"I found myself at the end of a game as Thanos.  1v1v1.  I had upwards of 20 kills as Thanos, but I ended up hiding in warehouses by Dusty Divot because I knew the other two had range on me.  I died like a coward. :(",,
,,,"Nobody is asking for Thanos to be nerfed?
EPIC: WE HEAR YA LOUD AND CLEAR!
SubReddit bands together to buff Thanos.
EPIC:  
",,
,,,Na  he's perfectly balanced not like the shotguns are. ,,
,,,Nerfed so more people get the chance to ~~play~~ die as Thanos.,,
,,,It also does not favor being the first to pick up the gauntlet,,
,,,"I saw a thread below this one that had a picture for Thanos mode with duos and squads.  But what if they had Normal Thanos, Hard Thanos, and Insane Thanos modes where you could pick how hard of a boss he was.  In Insane friendly fire is off and he's crazy broken and anyone not Thanos is a team against him until he dies.  That way normal would have more players try him, hard would be a little bit buffed from his pre nerf state and insane gets a true boss feel.",,
,,,I don’t get why there’s so many complaints about Thanos. If you play correctly you should win the game. You can’t just push a group of a bunch of people. You need to take 1v1 fights. If you’re losing over 200 HP or your full shield health to one person you’re doing something wrong. The biggest mistake I see from Thanos players are jump charging while out in the open. You need to take cover before jumping. Also don’t use the laser like ever unless you’re in the open and someone is shooting you from a medium distance.,,
,,,"Na hes still ridiculously strong, you just have to actually be smart while playing him (huge shocker).",,
,,,Shouldn’t have been nerfed. Thanos being OP is the point of the mode IMO. ,,
,,,"I've wanted to say I think it's a little silly they show thanos with all the gems but he only uses the power gem. In regard to that defense move you were talking about, maybe a SPACE portal to swallow bullets, or a TIME ability to make him invulnerable or sprint incredibly fast but unable to attack.(these attacks would take the place of the build button and be charged up by kills AND possibly by destroying  player structures) MIND, SOUL, and REALITY would be a little much to let us mess with tho. Also please reduce the jump buildup by just a second or two. I think thanos is pretty great as is but the cooldown is a bit much.",,
,,,"All this is great and all but Epic really dropped the ball on this mode. It should have been like the old TF2 Boss servers. 

- Server full of people load in, get ready, all on same team

- Countdown ends and a random player is switched to the other team, and changed to the Boss. Different playermodel, abilities, sounds, and a shitload of health (often 5000)

- Players have to work together, it's all against the Boss. Player team wins if he dies, Boss wins if everyone else dies.


That way, it'd be everyone against Thanos, but there'd be an actual feeling of dread in the game. You have to drop, get a good loadout, and keep an eye on who's around you, to see if you see the Chosen disappear, because now he knows where there are players for the taking. It also promotes group building and teaming up, as the Boss can only pick off stragglers lest he be chewed up by gunfire. Imagine, Thanos gets a few picks on the rim of the circle, then punches his way through a fortress in the middle of the map, against a hail of minigun fire. **That** is what it should have been.

Or people's original suggestion of having the Gauntlet be a consumable, that spawns randomly and using it kills half the remaining players at random, so you can do it to make 100 people 50, or you can use it for an easy 1v1 win from across the map... if you can survive that long. Nobody would know where the Gauntlet spawns, or who has it, but the risk of random death is always looming, especially in the final 1v1.


The mode we got is cool for a little bit, but the standard modes are still more fun, imo",,
,,,"Agreed. I don't fear Thanos, I just wait and pick off others until its \<5 players and then a gold scar to the ehad while he waits to jump. It's kinda pathetic.  I don't even grab the gauntlet, I just trap it and kill the rest.",,
,,,I think Epic wants to avoid the constant complaints of people never getting the gauntlet by making him nerfed so many players can use the gauntlet each game.,,
,,,We did it! They nerfed him again!,,
,,,I still insist that he should have an ability where he wipes out half the players,,
,,,"Give him 1 stone with 5 others hidden around the map! Once you find them all, you should be able to snap your fingers and eliminate half of the remaining players!",,
,,,They did this to let more people play as him. Get over it ,,
,,,"Totally agree, Thanos changes hands so fast.

In a 1v1, Thanos should be almost positive to win so that it makes no sense to leave him alive while going after others.",,
,,,"I agree.
Quicker jump, Longer Range laser and more health.

He should be almost impossible to take down solo.

Edit: Also a shield on cooldown would be awesome. Then you cold time it with a big jump.

Still a lot fun and more polished than I thought it'd be.

,,,Orange Assualt destroys him. In the time it took me to jump i lost all shields and a third of my health. ,,
,,,TAKES TOO LONG TO JUMP OMG,,
,,,Can we stop pretending that the average reddit user can 1v1 Thanos lmao ,,
,,,Honestly I stopped playing that mode because I am always shooting Thanos at a range and some noskin picks me off from behind. I'm like what's the point of this mode if children and bads think it's a mode where they finally can get some kills.,,

,,,"I dont think he was OP at all, I'm a pretty average player and on my first game I ended up 1v1 with him and beat him pretty easy. It definitely takes away from getting that guantlet. ",,

,,,"I totally agree. I played with him before he got nerfed, never got the gauntlet, won and got 6 eliminations (Thanos died by the storm). I think he’s very weak for what he was supposed to be, a boss fight. They should buff him considerably, maybe even by making him take way less damage in the storm, so that it only works as a way to push him to the PvP zone, but not as an immediate threat to him. ",,
,,,Not to mention it’s ridiculous this LTM counts toward wins and stats in the solo column! *face palm* ,,
,,,I had some killer dance parties while in hiding with some ladies and gentlemen ,,
,,,the delayed jump is the big problem. He should operate similarly to how hulk in 'ultimate destruction' works. I've won 4 or 5 games of infinity gauntlet and only one has been with Thanos. 1v1 is relatively simple. Just snipe him while hes about to jump and then lay in with scar....drop some walls/roofs while hes in the air to hide. Repeat again.  ,,
,,,"No matter what way they change it the mode isn't going to be fun. Game modes like this never really are. If you're a good player you're just gonna be like this is too easy I'm just gonna play solos. If you're a bad player you're just gonna be like this sucks it's too hard. So when they nerf/buff him each side of the coin are just going to complain. 

I tried it and it got boring after about 5 games of it. ",,
,,,I played got 11 kills solo’d thanos he’s not that hard tbh if you don’t believe me YouTube (Mike Jay Fortnite),,
,,,"If Thanks was stronger then it would be a pain to fight him 1v1. They barely nerfed him, they just made him less cheap because 300 shield is a lot. He’s still crazy strong, and from what I’ve seen some people fail at knowing how to fight Thanos, and some people suck at using Thanos. ",,
,,,Yeah it's quite disappointing to be honest. I haven't had the chance to play as him yet but I just played a game where somebody killed Thanos and left us in a 1v1 situation. The other got the gauntlet but I still killed him only by blocking his laser with wooden wall spam and then melting him with a scar whilst he was in his jump animation. This would have definitely been better as an all against Thanos mode as he's very puny at the moment.,,
,,,"I like the idea of there being a boss, but personally I don't like this Avengers cross over. It feels out of place. Imagine an original boss, maybe a storm related one?",,
,,,Give him a 5 kill streak where he blows up the moon and rains down rocks on ypu,,
,,,I wish I got to play be fore the nerf. I watched some streams and though yeah he needed to be nerfed. Make him more powerful please. More than originally.,,
,,,Yes! But you must remember that all your stats count in that ltm but it would be great for a buff,,
,,,"Thanos should absolutely be more powerful. As someone who played immediately after the update and actually succeeded in defeating Thanos in a 1v1 Solo before the nerf and clutching Victory Royale, it felt incredible. Although the following matches afterwards it wasn’t all too challenging. 

You land within the circle or at least close proximity. Collect loot and patiently wait for Thanos to appear. Now you just locate clueless and unknowing players while preoccupied with Thanos. Once the storm begins to close in it becomes more of a threat than Thanos IMHO. At this point it’s easy to take advantage of players as well as Thanos. It’s somewhat fun and entertaining, but simple and easy.

After learning Thanos was nerfed I was extremely disappointed. He should feel threatening and unstoppable but not impossible. I want to run or hide in fear and potentially discover other players willing to cooperate for the greater good of the Fortnite universe. 

Thanos undoubtedly needs a buff. After multiple wins and 1v1 success against Thanos, it’s depressingly just “meh.” So many people sharing wonderful ideas and concepts. I believe this is something most of the community can agree with.

Lastly for those players that would insist on picking off players while defending themselves from Thanos, you made your choice. Then there’s the players that would team up and attempt to eliminate said players along with Thanos. This is how I would prefer it and possibly other people.",,
,,,imo thanos mostly just needs a way to return hp. 1v1s he's great but eventually you'll just for from chip damage,,
,,,Amen,,
,,,They should add this once thanos dies that he can use his time stone so he can give himself a second chance and has full 200 shields and 250 health ,,
,,,"I don’t know what you’re talking about, he seems pretty beefed up to me ",,
,,,"The best way to win as thanks is to hide on top of a mountain and kill anybody that tries to get up, passive thanos= unfun thanos",,
,,,"This game mode sucks, it’s basically a bunch of people trying to kill an overpowered opponent while others shoot them in the back.  Regular BR is a clusterfuck but this one came with a side of retarded.  Maybe I don’t know how to play this game mode correctly?!?  Just seems stupid.  Just look how people acted in 50v50 when they were on your own team.  The only way to even get the gauntlet is deploy your glider and fly till it drops then your too late to get any weapons if you didn’t already land in circle and someone else has the glove.",,
,,,"Lol this sub is crazy. The first 4 hours after patch it was just thread after thread upvoted saying this is blitz with an OP Thanos running around and it was so unfair to play against him. Now all the threads say the opposite. I had fun playing as Thanos, but for my wins with him I had to use the terrain and sometimes I had to back off fights I wanted to take. I think it's fun for what it is and a nice little refresher between real matches(as LTMs should be).",,
,,,"Thanos should get a one time use skill as well. Snap your fingers and randomly half of the lobby is gone, you get to be thanks still but extremely nerfed",,
,,,Oh yeah this was so annoying. After trying for about 2 hours I was finally able to try playing him and it honestly felt like other players could overpower me. I didn’t feel like a boss I just felt like the power of 2 normal players or something. I was getting kills left and right for a while but in the top 5 my health was drained so much from people getting headshots on me with scars that I almost had to hide from people. I almost got the win when I activated a jump and got absolutely lasered by one person and killed. A boss shouldn’t feel scared and be able to be 1v1’ed by one player from a few meters away,,
,,,"what they should do: 
- decrease laser damage to 10
- increase laser damage to structures to 35
- increase laser range (like 180 m)
- increase health to 1000
- increase shield to 300
- decrease healing per kill to 150 shield
- decrease jump loading time to 1.5 sec. 

(- add a new attack, wich summons a shield and blocks 5 shots from that direction, has a cooldown of 15 sec.)",,
,,,"The general core aspects of the game are good but there are some major problems definitely. 
1. The Gauntlet should spawn the same way as it does currently and players should be able to kill other players UNTIL the gauntlet is put on and Thanos enters the field. Then Friendly Fire holds no damage and everyone bands together to fight Thanos. 99vThanos. If Thanos is killed friendly fire is turned off, everyone fights for control of the gauntlet until it is obtained, and so forth. 

2. Thanos’s attacks need to be buffed both in damage and range, and he also should have more then 3 attacks. If he has six stones, he should have 6 attacks or at least 6 actions, whether they be offense or defense. 

Time Stone: Should be able to rewind the battle field (or at least everyone in a certain proximity to Thanos) back 5-10 maybe even 15 seconds to correct mass amounts of damage taken to Thanos. 2:00 minutes to regain this ability 

Space Stone: Should allow Thanos to teleport around the map 1-2 square blocks away from his current position. 60 seconds to regain this ability

Reality Stone: AoE attack that briefly neutralizes all enemy fire and replaces bullets with bubbles, fireworks, squirt guns, etc. Effect lasts for 10 seconds. 2:00 minutes to regain this ability.

Power Stone: Just really needs a buff. The beam doesn’t do enough damage and doesn’t reach far enough.

Mind Stone: Should allow Thanos to temporarily phase through bullets (much like Vision) for a 15 or 30 second period. 2:00 minutes to regain this ability.

Soul Stone: Should allow Thanos to see all players still alive on the field, both on his mini map and as a glowing orange aura through walls, buildings and hills. Effect lasts for 1:00 minute. 2:00 minutes to regain this ability.

3. Let him keep his punches and large jumping capabilities, just shorten the period it takes him to charge up his jumps. 

4. Also the goal of the game is to fight Thanos... stop spawning common or even uncommon weapons. Epic, Legendary or Rare only. With these adjustments lord knows you’ll need them.",,
,,,"> where players will work together to kill him, instead of hunting each other

Yeah, good luck with that. They could give a Thanos literally 1 million health and players will still be so dumb to not work against an unstoppable being.",,
,,,"His laser range is so short it can't even stop a guy using a launchpad 120ft away, 0 damage.",,
,,,"I don't like the idea of not being able to kill other players that aren't Thanos.  I mean sure it's annoying when you're trying to team of up on Thanos and someone betrays you and shotguns you after you've both danced.  But I've been in a few games where Thanos went down and I had to snipe the player running towards the gauntlet.  I would much rather shoot that guy then deal with a full HP Thanos.

That said, my double launch pad strategy has worked really well so far. Drop 2 launch pads just close enough to land next to it from the other one, and bounce back and forth while sniping/rocketing Thanos.  The player always get too flustered to smash the launch pads because they're trying to attack you.",,
,,,currently it's Solo except there's one slightly stronger boi,,
,,,I also dont appreciate how they have him say the end is near each time there is a Thanos. His goal isnt to wipe out all life. The goal is to bring balance. EPIC WILL YOU RIGHT THE WRONGS?,,
,,,it would have to be something for where in the end game or anytime when the glove is on the ground it’s a free for all method i guess they want to keep the battle royals concept going ,,
,,,"I feel like it should be like 50 v 50 except Thanos v 99. Thanos should feel menacing, he's pretty fair and balanced at the current state.",,
,,,"I understand he should feel more op but there is more to this than just being strong as Thanos it is also getting to PLAY as Thanos.

I understand he is not strong right now but if he was crazy op and hard to kill then the fact remains that very few people would get to play Thanos per game which is the only thing different about this game mode. So if you never get to play as Thanos you are basically just playing a faster paced game of fortnite with better drops.

Part of the balance is that Thanos should die so multiple people get a shot at trying out the cool new thing added to fortnite otherwise its just frustrating. Imagine seeing this cool mode come out but because Thanos is really OP and only dies 0-2 times you never get to play him. I would be pretty bummed about it. 

I am not saying Thanos should be super weak that anyone could kill him. I am just saying this game mode is supposed to be fun and since there really is only one part of this that is new to enjoy it is better to have a lot of shots at getting the gauntlet.

Personally though I would have rather had some like PVE 100 vs Thanos game mode where he is insanely OP with cool animations and powers so everyone needs to work together to kill him for some kind of cosmetic. That is probably more along the lines of save the world though.",,
,,,"He needs access to soul, time, reality and mind stones. He has power and space now. He should be able to idk charge a shockwave that turns guns into bubble beams for reality, he could have his time stone restore damage he took over the past X seconds with X+Y cooldown for time, for mind he could make a player join his team for a duration and for soul he could use a move that causes players to have an outline visible to him through everything for a duration.

Thanos is a monster by himself but he isn't here and with the stones hes nigh unbeatable except by his own hubris. In fortnite hes just a shitty rare gun.",,
,,,"The Power Beam (which is awful) should steal health. 

That gives him a chance to come back from the constant chip damage, and a reason to use it. ",,
,,,"Just have him do something that will kill some people, and have the remaining fight together.",,
,,,"It's easy to win has thanos right now has long has you only jump behind cover and make sure you don't land out of range of your energy attack when chasing an enemy if your in the open.

Jump near trees that give you cover when you jump

Jump into the middle of building so walls cover you from jumping ect

If they just build just jump right under there building which gives you cover for a easy smash and the melee kill after

I get most my kills with his melee attack.
",,
,,,"I got excited to fight one today, I had 4 jump pads, rockets, gold scar, and he dies to circle... Woo I win..",,
,,,The game should be Super Ninjanaut Halo 2 style. I want to run in fear from Thanos and work with the other 99 to take him down. ,,
,,,I suck ass at the game so killing people as they try and attack Thanos makes me feel better about myself. Sorry,,
,,,"I think he should be buffed in the beginning, since there is so much players to kill him, But when there is like 10 people left, he should be nerfed since there isn’t much people to gang up on him.",,
,,,"Should just be a 50v50 with both teams fighting for the gauntlet. 

Or 50 v 50 where one side gets Thanos and the other gets Thor",,
,,,shut the fuck up you whining kid about Thanos too op. is good you kid whining about too powerful.,,
,,,"I’ve had so many moments tonight where I’ve just been super pissed at people because I’m trying to team with them to kill thanos so that whoever gets he gauntlet first can have it but instead when I’m fighting him people target me instead. Then immediately after they kill me, Thanos notices and kills them - it’s direct karma but still it’s annoying to be playing the OBJ to kill Thanos then some thirsty (redacted) shoots me in the back just because they want kills and not to actually play the game mode. It’s easy kills for them since they can land first then kill the 10+ weaponless people who were hovering while waiting for the gauntlet. ",,
,,,"I definitely agree, I got the gauntlet off the rip, and dropped 16 kills as Thanos only to get killed by a bush and another guy (teaming) both with RPGs while I tried to jump.",,
,,,They should get rid of it and spend more time on skins ,,
,,,Maybe if they implemented a teammate radius around Thanos the mode could work.. Meaning if you’re in the circle you can’t shoot anyone else who’s in the circle other than of course Thanos.,,
,,,Thanos should have special abilities from the comics. In the Infinity Gauntlet comet he puts a box around Cyclops head suffocates him to death and kills Captain America with a backhand ,,
,,,Agreed.   He needs to be like 25-40% more powerful and faster.    I've seen great players 1v1 him decently well.  ,,
,,,"I understand he can’t be OP, but he’s supposed to be with the gauntlet the most powerful being in the galaxy being able to solo him is kinda pointless",,
,,,I agree.  The trick might be to make him OP as fuck (I’m talking thousands of shield and HP) and turning friendly fire on for everyone else.  Everyone teams up.  Literal boss fight.  Small storm circle.  Idk.  ,,
,,,"Epic doesn't know what they are doing. 

The entire LTM is a mess. 

Just not fun.",,
,,,"Don't worry, the game mode is only available for a limited time. We should be thankful that they even did a marvel crossover!",,
,,,"Idk I just got a 21 kill game where I got him from the start, and I won. He’s not terrible but perhaps reverting his shields will be good enough. If you know how to use him he’s unstoppable 

Edit: just got another 19 kill with thanos from the start. He’s not bad",,
,,,Capable of demolishing Earth’s Mightiest Heroes all gangbanging him but not capable of making some bushes running around with guns intimidated.,,
,,,"I highly disagree that Thanos should be more powerful, in fact I think he is in a perfect state. In the last 30 seconds of my game shown here: http://sendvid.com/42yxzq4q

Thanos already had only like 200 life left when he finished off the only other opponent besides me ( which gave him 200 shields ). Despite me getting the jump on him and hitting him a bunch of times, he still gets to cover and launches in the air and laser beams me to 5% health even though I was nailing him the entire time with assault rifle shots. Although I won I barely did with just 5 hp. This shows that even in his weakened state he is insanely difficult for another play to beat 1v1 even when you get the drop on him. Even the slightest buff would pretty much make any Thanos player have the auto win in the late game.",,
,,,"Ya i was super stoked to play this, turns out it just feels like a regular solo 90% of the time. His movement just feels terrible. nothing fun about stun locking yourself for 10 seconds when you try to jump. ",,
,,,Imagine a ultimate move which makes people in a specific radius “not feel so good” (don’t wanna give spoilers),,
,,,"I like the new mode for mucking about.  It should not count towards your stats thought until this ltm I hadn't had a solo win now I have three and I feel like I've cheated.

Also think they should have done a 50vs 50  with two superhero/villain one for each side.",,
,,,I know I thought he was super weak then they nerfed him... the entire map knowing where you are and your health is such a horrible debuff he needs to be strong,,
,,,People won't stop shooting eachother no matter how strong thanos is. That's just how they are used to the game unfortunately...,,
,,,"Seriously, I went into a 1v1 with thanos and killed him with a gold scar and a blue pump",,
,,,Thanos should have 5k health with 2k armor plus 5 sec active armor in every 1 min.,,
,,,I managed to play him pre nerf I’m so happy I did ,,
,,,"Each kill using Thanos should grant you an infinity stone, with increased stats and unlock-able abilities.  ",,
,,,"I got five epic victorys yesterday in LTM, while i was only able to win one single solo match in the past months. Feels wrong. ",,
,,,Mostly his jump is too slow.  Minigun + stickies = how the avengers should have ended.,,
,,,"Its honestly so stupid how under performing his is.

,
Punches, they have zero range. You can easily dodge them or outrun punch spam. They need some tracking or to build up speed tbe more punches you throw.

Power beam. Only good for kill unshielded noobs. Any good player will just place down a wall and you just wasted your attack and now 5 john wicks are shooting you with scars and youre dead. This attack shoukd do double damage to buildings. It also need to be a hold ability instead of channeled. That way you can decide to hild the beam as long as you want.

Jump. Needs a complete overhaul. The ground slam is such a little radius for so little damage. It needs to be a one shot because of how easy it is to dodge this attack. Also, the jump animation takes way too long. It needs to be a charve ability. Hold it a little. It for a quick jump, or a long time for a higher jump.

In addition, there really needs to be a shield to stop projectiles coming at you, even if its for 5 seconds max. Because a decent player and take away half your health while youre struggling to rea h them.

Also, there needs to be a way to heal thanos. Right now its punishing good thanos players, because the longer they stay alive, the more damage they take from trading with bads that manage to knock your shiekd off and deal 100 damage before dying. I think yoj should be healed for like 10% of your health everytime a storm ring closes. 

I kind of get the feeling that this ltm was more of just a cash grab deal with marvel and was thrown together without much care.",,
,,,but what about the ability to change omega's glow color? so much orange..,,
,,,"The only problem i have with this is that would kinda make the whole battle royale game mode usless. it would always end with thanos winning. if hes too op for one person to solo kill him, then the non thanos player has no chance in the end 1v1.
",,
,,,"He is still overpowered, he can fucking punch you through walls lol.",,
,,,"Yeah right, randoms will NEVER work together to kill him because they want to be sure it is THEM who gets the gauntlet. Super strong Thanos would just run a train on solos who would never coordinate to take him down (after all they are competing right?). I think the gamemode should have just allowed squads, or at least duos to make Thanos more powerful accordingly. ",,
,,,Doesn’t help that his head hitbox is enormous. Like just giant and easy to plug bullets into.,,
,,,Well if he snaps once half the players r dead,,
,,,"This at the very least should’ve been released in “Squads”, and whoever gets the gauntlet breaks off from the team. Throws in some puppy-guarding strategies as well as eventual betrayals, if one (such as myself 😋) desires. It being in “Solo” is just sad.",,

What happens if you're standing there on that ledge but you intend to put the wall a space away? Following your mechanics that wouldn't be possible so your reach is effectively shortened unless you aren't standing on a floor? Seems inconsistent to me, this is coming from about 18+ days played. ",,

This is what gaming styles create an algorithm from your choices of action and try to match your game style of playing.. its obvious people don't have the same gaming tactics.

Right now the dominant strategy just seems to be to sprint at people while building, shoot once with the Pump shotty, then switch to the Tac and fire like crazy.

The ARs just feel too inaccurate at everything but ranges where you can easily just build and close the distance anyway. I'd generally rather have a Sniper or Rocket weapon in most cases, and in mid-range fights where a Sniper's hard to use, just build-charging with the Shotties generally turns out better anyway.

And I don't really see a point at all to SMGs or LMGs. Right now the only use for LMGs seems to be destroying cover quickly and the only use for SMGs is having something to hold until you find a shotgun.",,

,,,"Might actually be helpful at times... I ended up in 2nd place when I thought there were 3 left, I would have played a 1v1 different. Hearing a death instead of looking for the message would have got my attention!",,
,,,I’m laughing so hard me and my friend said this exact thing last night. Including once it reaches top 10. Lol,,
,,,"I made a post similar to this, but just saying there should be more of an indication of people dying at the end. Great idea to have the cannon sound, I like it. ",,
,,,The developers would never just steal an idea from something that wildly popular. ,,
,,,Is it just me or do the supply drops already sound like distant artillery fire?,,
,,,Keen,,
,,,I like that a lot a lot!,,
,,,That would be unreal ,,
,,,Yes this would add some much more anxiety to top ten I love this ! Please add it in ! ,,
,,,Additional suggestion: the canon is louder the closer you are to the person who died,,
,,,Ark survival of the fittest did this for everykill and it was awesome. Added much more anxiety to surviving and made each kill all the more satisfying. ,,
,,,"this is to good, probably one of the only things i want in a battle royal game",,
,,,This is the only idea on this subreddit I fully support. EPIC PLS,,
,,,It also needs fireworks when you win,,
,,,Please make this happen,,
,,,That would be awesome. ,,
,,,Great idea!,,
,,,That’s actually a cool idea.,,
,,,Tweet that shit. Make it happen. ,,
,,,"Great, another thing to make me shit my pants and lose.. /s 

Love the idea OPPPP",,
,,,Kind of silly but this would make the game sooo intense,,
,,,"No.

This game doesn't need any more distracting sound effects.",,
,,,I first need to get to Top 10 :(,,
,,,Honestly this would make things feel a lot more intense... and I would like it lol,,
,,,"Mr. Hillman, make this happen!",,
,,,Spice idea fam,,
,,,Or the thunder strike from MC Survival Games ,,
,,,"When a squads last member gets downed, do we hear four simultaneous ear blasts",,
,,,It'd be even scarier if the kill feed went out and you had to rely solely on the cannons to know how many people were left,,
,,,With each death the cannon gets louder and louder ,,
,,,this is such an amazing idea omg,,
,,,Lmfao this would be perfect. The cannon shot must have a dramatic echo though. ,,
,,,All the ideas on this sub are fucking retarded and cringey,,
,,,How is this getting upvotes,,
,,,And have a ship come pick up their body,,
,,,"Not keen, this isn't the hunger games. 
I haven't seen hunger games though so probably don't get the reference enough.",,
,,,i would love this for the whole match ,,
,,,This is something i can imagine in pubg more but hey i guess it'd be cool,,
,,,"When I first started playing this game I could have swore I heard a scream in the distance, I thought it was when people died. ",,
,,,Honestly that already plays in my head every time I see that someone’s been killed,,
,,,in b4 the canons hit massive structures and the final 2 fall to death at the same time.,,
,,,Another cool thing would be to send up a firework or flare when the someone dies in top 10 ,,
,,,I would time my pushes accordingly,,
,,,Yes we need a petition asap,,
,,,Ohhh I just misunderstood it. I thought he meant once it reached the top ten it started to list everyone who was in the game names.,,
,,,"They've already got the sound for it, they can just play the handcannon audio.",,
,,,eliminated - xXx5up3rULtr@Pu55y5L@y3rxXx,,
,,,This is perfect to tie into an LTM imo. ,,
,,,And for squads it would be last remaining 5 squads,,
,,,Now i want a hyperrealistic Hunger Games game in VR. But that will take a really long time to make and for the technology to get there.,,
,,,10 chances to have heart attack berore top 1,,
,,,"I thought that was already in the game? Once you reach top 30, there's a sort of boom sound, again at 20, then 15 and 10 and also 5. It's like the storm sound when it starts closing but not actually that sound",,
,,,This would be amazing.,,
,,,Epic Idea,,
,,,What if you down 3 guys in the same team then kill off the final teammate? Would there be 4 cannon sounds in quick succession?,,
,,,And each death cannon gets louder and louder to up the intensity. Maybe with the last 2 people they could play intense music...,,
,,,That would be so cool,,
,,,And a Christopher Nolan soundtrack from either Inception or Dunkirk playing in the background that gets dramatically louder with each death,,
,,,YESSSSSSS YESSS,,
,,,Id die on purpose just to see it,,
,,,What if you kill a full squad at the same time? Is it going to be 4 shots all at the same time? Or will it be 4 shots over a few seconds?,,
,,,"Imagine if the cannons destroyed player built structures. That would be fun, not having to camp in a base in the top 10.",,
,,,Tbh fortnite is pretty much hunger games ,,
,,,"pls do it @epicgames
",,
,,,"That would be awesome, 10/10 would recommend ",,
,,,"Cool idea, but the ""killing game"" meme would be revived",,
,,,Omg yes please!!!,,
,,,SquirtyBum11: ELIMINATED,,
,,,I’m shitting my pants thinking about this actually happening. ,,
,,,God thats the best idea on this sub. Pleaseeeeeeee,,
,,,I’d be mindful of the noise pollution cause people may be listening carefully for nearby enemies. I would say though that they could put up a hologram of the banner and the handle of each fallen hero straight up in the sky!,,
,,,Omg yes.,,
,,,Too many of the suggestions on this thread would cause difficulty sound whoring. This game is definitely one where you need to hear,,
,,,"Or the top 24 like in the hunger games (there were only 12 teams), but maybe that's too much. It was like that in Minecraft, but with lightning bolts.",,
,,,I got goosebumps reading that. It would bring so much excitement. Pls epic make ithappen!,,
,,,I used to think that was what the critical hit sound when you're pickaxing things was. ,,
,,,Like the Easter Egg Launcher sound?,,
,,,"Or they should put big alarm towers around the map that go off on Top 10 and alert players, have an announcer that basically reads the killfeed ",,
,,,"Could the number change color maybe, like the timer does? I’ve won tons of squad games in surprise because I’m focused on fighting rather than how many people are left. ",,
,,,"Or like when an entire squad/duo is killed in the top 10, would be quite interesting. You won't really be wondering if there's still a member running around somewhere, you will just listen for the signal to know if they're all dead.",,
,,,"OMG THATS FUCKING PERFECT, something like in darwin project would be nice!",,
,,,So much yes! Scary cannon please!!,,
,,,Currently reading the hunger games and this idea is awesome,,
,,,Why not when there's 24 people? Would be pretty cool easter egg!,,
,,,Only if they replace the kill feed though,,
,,,No thanks I would shit myself,,
,,,"*dies, but in a cooler fashion*",,
,,,But the Hunger Games were Duos right? Two people from each district. Peeta & Katniss etc.,,
,,,"It should take a random picture from your webcam and show your face in the sky at the exact moment of your death, so it captures your reaction...",,
,,,Alao remove the player counter so you can't see how many is left so all you gotta rely on is the cannon sound to know how many is left.,,
,,,"Come on epic, this wud be fun!",,
,,,"Every death could have a cannon fire off in the last 10, and every cannon getting progressively louder.",,
,,,Yessss,,
,,,Yeees,,
,,,It would also scare the everloving shit out of me so that's a plus.,,
,,,"😂😂 i do, its more a social experiment cause Im mr krabs",,
,,,See their skin and name up.in the sky too? Can it be done?,,
,,,You guys realize this already happens right? A cannon fires for the first 10 or so ,,
,,,I'd like it more if they did this and then removed the 'players left' number from your screen so you have to keep count how many players are left by the blasts. ,,
,,,What the fuck that's so genius. Please add it Epic!!,,
,,,"Wouldn't top 24 be more fitting ?  
Since there are (normally) that many participants in the Hunger Games",,
,,,There would be a looot of cannon fires the beginning of the game.,,
,,,Why not the top 24?,,
,,,"and have the top 5 people that died and there skins and gamertags like just chilling on a projector 
",,
,,,I think the hand canon is loud enough,,
,,,Best idea I have ever heard,,
,,,The cannon sounds from people dying in paragon could be great here.,,
,,,"When I first started playing I thought that this was an actual thing cause I would always hear some really loud booms when people died, thinking they were just laggy cannons that couldn’t  keep up with the deaths. But, no. it was 3 kiddos trying to kill each other with bazookas ",,
,,,"I would love this
",,
,,,"A way cooler atmosphere, with no real downside to gameplay, I like the idea my man ",,
,,,No,,
,,,monkaS,,
,,,This is actually a pretty good idea. Sometimes I fail to pay attention to the people left because I’m so focused on trying to find them. This would help me keep track way easier while still staying focused. ,,
,,,I'd say top 25 would be cooler as one of the other comments say it makes it more tense and when there's a quarter of the people left I think that's when it should get really into it! Love the idea though!,,
,,,But you already hear the guns being used to kill people. This is completely unnecessary.,,
,,,Ohhhh boi yes,,
,,,"Ummm yeah no.  When I get to top 10 in solo, I'm watching the kill feed and player count all the time, counting players I see and where.

There is no need for more visual distractions.  I'd actually like the storm shrinking announcements to be smaller and not in the center of the screen.  

I feel like when I play solo and I'm not going for challenges but for a win, I want less distractions then when I play squads.

,,,Or just give us custom games with custom rulesets ( including infinite materials ) instead of limiting it to a sandbox mode.,,
,,,Just did before a tread about it we need 1v1 building fight practice!!,,
,,,You can get great building practice on STW,,
,,,Don't you mean Wailing Woods?,,
,,,"This could help new players understand the building mechanic faster as it is the most important one, consider it like a tutorial mode or something :\)",,
,,,"In the mean time, 50v50 is a good place to practice. ",,
,,,I was thinking a combat training mode would be cool! Like from black ops 1 where you can practice against AI with changeable difficulty. ,,
,,,Just build lol,,
,,,I want them to add a training range to test out all the new stuff whenever there’s an update so you don’t have to play 50 matches to get 20 seconds with the new weapons,,
,,,"As much as I do support a sandbox mode, the best way to get better at building is playing the game with the intent to get in building fights. Forget about wins, go shotgun only and ramp rush into people's faces, think about your mistakes and correct them. ",,
,,,"Step 1 50v50
Step 2 drop wailing woods
Step 3 mouse and keyboard button mash
Step 4 ??",,
,,,Yes please. Us console plebs need all the practice we can get. ,,
,,,It’s finally happening ,,
,,,well...,,
,,,It became true,,
,,,"Even though I don’t need it but I would just play it to just have fun, maybe make it so your friends can join and you can just have build battles ",,
,,,So basically mine craft in fortnite?,,
,,,Yes But without timelimit,,
,,,🤔🤔🤔🤔,,
,,,[deleted],,
,,,There’s no reason that this shouldn’t be a thing. Don’t know what these guys at Epic are waiting for.,,
,,,"Also all weapons and items available with unlimited supply. Would be good testing out rocket and grenade launches as I don't usually get that far to obtain one and when I do I'm a complete noob at it and blow myself up.
Maybe a shooting range in this mode too with moving targets to practice shooting and sniping.
",,
,,,Yes!,,
,,,"Yeah sandbox mode would be amazing it would be great if you can have a lobby with just you and your squad.

Then have options to turn on friendly fire and insta respawns, so you can practice different scenarios",,
,,,For me it wouldn't be as useful. When I'm not worried about others I'm an architect. When I'm in a fight and try to build I forget everything. ,,
,,,"Doesn’t really seem like Epic is interested in creating game modes for offline play. They seem more into the line of thinking that “if you wanna be good, get good in-game.” ",,
,,,just have the pregame lobby give people infinite mats.  they already reset the mats right?,,
,,,You guys do realize that fortnite base game teaches you how to build and helps you practice.. Battle royale is just a spin off mode..,,
,,,I’ve been saying this forever ,,
,,,"yes i would love this
",,
,,,"I love it. This and maybe some kind of arena where you can respawn and battle non stop to work on aim. At the same time though, I think its part of the skill of the game that you can only practice building in game, which makes building even more impressive. Im happy either way though.",,
,,,"One big thing I think people are overlooking, in addition to build and gun practice people can mess with their key bindings and sensitivity settings without worrying about being killed.

Regardless suggested this idea could weeks ago and submitted via official feedback in game. Hopefully in 4.3 we'll get it.",,
,,,50v50 gives double mats. Just land in moisty or wailing and start there. But a sandbox would b awesome not gunna lie! ,,
,,,I would fucking love if they kept “just build lol” in the description,,
,,,"Everyone gets their own lobby with no time limit. You get a lobby, you get a lobby, everybody gets their own loooooobbbyy!!!",,
,,,Welll,,
,,,"Just came back to this post now, predicted it didn’t ya",,
,,,"If there was a sandbox mode, Although you would probably improve, all the try hards would grind it to get super good and players would improve even more than you did. ",,
,,,They already have that. It’s called 50v50,,
,,,[deleted],,
,,,Did you just suggest they make Minecraft?,,
,,,True true. But still a training mode/practice range would be nice 👍,,
,,,Just buy the real game if you really want this ,,
,,,[deleted],,
,,,Just build lol,,
,,,"yeah , its called Save the World / PVE mode which you buy (will be f2p) and earn 50-100 v buk everyday ...",,
,,,"that would be so cool!

*edit: eventually not on the spawn island but an seperated area (or just the normal map)",,
,,,Yes please,,
,,,It would be great to haveinfinite ammo and guns to test.,,
,,,That would be really nice. Lets hope epic will add this feature in one day,,
,,,Cooool,,
,,,Watch us get this on the next major update😂😂😂,,
,,,And practicing aim,,
,,,"It would be great place to practice, bind or configure the keys. And...EPIC please use diferent layouts for keybinding between FortniteBR and save the World!! please!",,
,,,"I play Xbox, this would be great",,
,,,"what would make that mode idea even better is a shooting range, that way you can test out and practice all weapons, even the ones they just add in, or even ones like Thanos' infinity gauntlet that are extremely limited",,
,,,Would also be a great way to explore the map without being interrupted.,,
,,,Inb4 sued by Minecraft,,
,,,lol Minecraft creative mode,,
,,,I need any non\-game mode where I can also mess around with keybinds and figure out what works for me. I don't want to mess around with that stuff in game. ,,
,,, they should  make the button layouts the same for STW. That would prevent the awkward transition between game types for those that play both daily & also give the people that bought the game a chance to practice building while playing save the world missions all at once.  ,,
,,,I would love this but would really love it to be on the full map. I would also add unlimited jump pads. That will allow us to get down easily if we build some crazy stuff. It would allow us to travel the map quickly if we want to practice in other areas. ,,
,,,It would be very good to have that in game. to learn how to build and test new binds. I feel it difficult to change some keys and then go ingame trying to figure how to not get stuck with new keybindings,,
,,,"There should be a mode where it's a new map and the skybox is much higher.  No pickaxe (but you can still edit anyone's structure just not the base, either that or editing a building piece has a 2 minute cooldown or 45 second delay to fend off the griefers), unlimited materials, no fall damage, and you have to build to catch a bird by building a box around it.  All 100 players can collaborate and must catch the bird in 15 minutes.

This idea could also be expanded to a 50v50 with multiple birds and the team that catches the most birds within the time limit wins.  The bird in the 100 v 1 would be much faster than in this mode.

Not only do you get to practice building competitively, but it could be a fun mode for more to play.",,
,,,I'd actually play in just that mode. ,,
,,,please i've been asking for this since i first started playing the game,,
,,,lol,,
,,,"50v50 is honestly great for practice. Drop on your side wherever all the trees are. And zone and enemies won’t touch you for a while.

Also mats are like 1.5x in 50s I think",,
,,,And Sandbox Squad.,,
,,,[deleted],,
,,,I’m a bit new and I’ve found 50v50 to be great for learning to build ,,
,,,Give the people what they want @epicgames,,
,,,"We asked for this the whole time Paragon was live, never got it. But we got MORE skins Yay!!!!! /s",,
,,,PLEASE EPIC,,
,,,This is a new idea.,,
,,,I've been wanting to break into fortnite but the building learning curve is so daunting. This addition would probably get me to play.,,
,,,This would be great. But I think a simple alternative would just be to give us max mats on spawn island and let us just sandbox there,,
,,,Yes please!!!!,,
,,,This X100,,
,,,I actual love this idea.,,
,,,I can't upvote this enough! Just like the Forge days in Halo 3!!!!!,,
,,,or save the world,,
,,,Please tell me that real,,
,,,Just turn the game into minecraft with guns ,,
,,,Play PVE for practice.  It’s pretty fun too,,
,,,Buy save the world. ,,
,,,I love this idea!,,
,,,Amen ,,
,,,This sounds so boring ,,
,,,Maybe have a way to play with your friends too? Kind of like a private match you could practice build battles on with quick respawn and reset of the map?,,
,,,Awesome idea!,,
,,,"I honestly don’t know why a game like fortnite doesn’t already have this. Look at halo, Minecraft, or any “build your own map” addition to any game, they were hugely successful. it allows the player to be more creative, introduce access to stuff like machinima, and expands the game’s initially narrow view into something additional without threatening the game’s core views.

Giving players the freedom of creativity not only attracts new players who otherwise were on the fence about the game, but it keeps new and old players around, even if they don’t feel like grinding xp anymore ",,
,,,That's called save the world,,
,,,Isn’t that kind of save the world though.,,
,,,"I think this would be great, but you learn so much better while under pressure and if your HP is at risk. Go to 50v50 to build. That’s how I got good at it. Let the rest of your team fight while you learn how to build and maneuver on the battlefield against an opponent just by using your materials. Real-world experience haha, if you want to look at it that way.",,
,,," I'd like to have it on the main island. I can study making bases in certain spots, or learning how to scale up or down hills. ",,
,,,"I think i speak for everyone when i say, we are ready for private matches, and this is the first step!",,
,,,I can't upvote this enough. ,,
,,,"I actually quit FNBR because whenever I try to build something it takes way too long and I fuck it up, but my enemies just build massive structures in moments. 

I looked for a tutorial mode that lets me practice building, but it wasn't there. Would pick up the game again if there was a sandbox mode. ",,
,,,"I agree it would be. I am not very good at building and someone like me could use practice where they won't stress about getting shot every minute. I suppose there is a negative though, if enough people practice building it may take away the affect of being a good builder. 
",,
,,,"This is nice, if they add this they should also add a deathmatch lobby to practice any weapons.",,
,,,(Custom games PLEASE!),,
,,,Great idea! Kinda like combat training in cod,,
,,,Or unlimited materials on spawn island. Will probably happen here soon.,,
,,,"PLEASE add this.. I only get to practice once in a while when I have a lot of mats and there isn't a lot happening during the mid game.. I know a lot of cool ways to build, but I never actually get to try them because I can basically only ""practice"" when there's a squad trying to kill me.",,
,,,It's caled STW lol,,
,,,"This would somehow make me die faster. 
It’s like I live in 98th place",,
,,,This would be amazing ,,
,,,"This is unfeasible. Epic already said this would put huge strains and demand on their servers. They could add a sandbox mode which is hosted on your machine and not a server, this would be ideal for practicing but as soon as you introduce another player, a decision needs to be made as to where to host the server/game.",,
,,,My guess is that when stw goes free they will encourage people to use that as practice.,,
,,,"What if there was also a mode with weapons, infinite materials, and respawns. I like the sandbox idea for learning to build but it’s a whole other thing to apply building to combat. Just thoughts! I love the idea op ",,
,,,I mean 50v50 anywhere away from the circle basically is a sandbox... get to practicing,,
,,,"“DON’T CREATE CONCEPTS” 

...

“Would be great building practice”

You creating this will mean that its likely it WONT be added to the game. ",,
,,,Fortnite Save the World?,,
,,,"Im usually not a big suggestion person but please epic, this is an idea that I strongly support. Being able to practice with your friends would also be helpful.",,
,,,"I want a 1v1 mode, that will help my pushing/building practice instead of going super aggro every game to get up to status quo ",,
,,,"I would die for this. Or the option to make private matches to fool around with your friends, do build offs and such. Hopefully Epic takes on this as they have done many times in the past! ",,
,,,Honestly just land wailing and build. Maybe they’ll finally release customs and people won’t have to ask for sandbox modes,,
,,,"""Just build lol""",,
,,,"Good call.  How about a practice mode for shooting practice as well.  You can choose any gun, and shoot at stationary and moving targets, where they keep track of the damage you've inflicted.  ",,
,,,I would love for this idea to be brought into the game. ,,
,,,Top twitter post,,
,,,Just build lol,,
,,,They need to add a practice mode. ,,
,,,"I think it would be good if and only if you can do it with friends. The thing about being proficient at building in this game is that it’s all situational. You have to build structures to gain and advantage over someone, and that is situational in every fight because a lot of them are different. 

I do think that it would be nice for people to be able practicing 1 by 1’s, doing an elevator, and double ramping, but outside of that so much of building is just reacting off what your opponent does. So I do feel like for that to be worth Epic’s time they need to make a sandbox mode multiplayer, because I know there are a few games that it is single player only, and I don’t think it works well in this case.",,
,,,"Would also be amazing if I could just use builder pro in the PvE can hold 15,000 mats in PvE plenty to practice with in my home base ",,
,,,This.,,
,,,please.,,
,,,Just practice in Minecraft ,,
,,,Would be great if I could stop seein this shit on mobile app. ,,
,,,"Does anyone here use STW (the PvE game) to practice building, shooting, and defenses? ",,
,,,"they offer this in stw amigo, these bastards want 40$ from ya",,
,,,So many people are asking for this so they have to add it eventually,,
,,,"***you know that already exists right?? When the BR mode is too popular lul, its named save the world, but correct me if you are litterally meant gmod/(god forbid) minecraft type of sandbox***",,
,,,It's part of the fun panicking to build when you're getting shot.,,
,,,"I practice in home Base ... STW is a little behind but still good practice 
",,
,,,There’s this crazy idea and you would not believe how good it works. It’s called playing the game and learning how to build in real situations. If you’re on console put on builder pro and start getting used to it. People just wanna be spoon fed when they have a difficult time learning a mechanic. ,,
,,,I have been playing the 50/50 specifically because it has been the best mode to build so far.,,
,,,I actually love this idea,,
,,,I have never wanted to “up” a post so much in my life!,,
,,,"There already is something like this and helps with buildeing a lot. There is this website called just build lol and it is a Fortnite building simulator with not people interrupting with your building.

,,,I clicked accept forgetting that I was only on reddit. :(,,
,,,Is this real or what...,,

,,,Also great for making shorts or fortnite movies etc.,,

,,,that would actually be really nice,,

,,,Why has epic not made this mode yet? I really want to practise advance building techniques and get as good as Myth himself. It'll be perfect to stick some dummy AI characters in this mode to practise shooting too.,,

Now, if it's been sorted automatically already, Ill probably smash the wrong button. in that situation I would not want the game to auto-sort

however, when i have a house to myself - in pleasant or whatever - after noticing I am by myself under this specific roof but i hear others shooting around.

,,,"No!! leave my small, mundane, tomater town alone. Don’t tell people it’s a good spot",,
,,,I don’t think it’s worth. The cons out weigh the pros ,,
,,,Nooooo that’s my not-so-secret-super-secret Landing spot!!!,,
,,,With maybe more than 1 chest for the whole town!,,

,,,"I still don’t believe that one house, a restaurant, a gas station and a convenience store can be classified as a town",,
,,,"tbh, just swap the positions of Tomato town and Tilted.",,
,,,"tomato 'TOWN' as a name has always confused me, its just a pizza shop, taco shop and a gas station..... what sorta town is that ",,
,,,Dont you dare touch my tomato town >:c,,
,,,My Italian culture is NOT your town,,
,,,Rename it Marinara Metropolis,,
,,,Nah,,
,,,"Seriously, this would help so much. Top right corner is uber garbage compared to all the other corners RN.",,
,,,How would that even fit,,
,,,Why is it even called tomato town in the first place like it’s legit a restaurant on the side of the road,,
,,,Slightly smaller and that would be a great idea ,,
,,,"Its funny how they call it ""tomato town"" but its only a building, a gas station, and a shack",,
,,,"Lol that's Sapienza from hitman, literally best map of that game! I'd really like a city like that mamma mia",,
,,,"needs more jpeg
",,
,,,"This is a fantastic idea! Tomato town is one of the smallest areas in the game with only 1 ""real"" building (others included two small buildings and a gas station), it's also in a prime location, near wailing and risky, two places less travelled.",,
,,,Leave my spot alone :(,,
,,,great idea,,
,,,This looks beautiful!,,
,,,Game has enough water as it is ,,
,,,Tomato city ,,
,,,"I dont usually agree with most of the ideas posted on here, but this is actually awesome",,
,,,Lololol Sapienza this is great,,
,,,That is top. So nice too! Have my upvote sir,,
,,,"I think the narrative here could be that due to the new influx of money brought to the island thanks to the meteor (lots of scientists love pizza amiright?), tomato town grew into a proper gourmet Italian pizza town.",,
,,,"It needs a face lift, it's an awful location ",,
,,,Yay Italy! ,,
,,,Lmao sapienza. Only if you include the morgue and mario and luigi,,
,,,Yes plz,,
,,,Tiltedmatoes,,
,,,That overhead view is legit. One of the best suggestions I've seen in a long time. Amazing mock-up and idea!,,
,,,I knew from the pros and cons this is an r/2007scape user,,
,,,"If not tilted size, at the very least make more stories to the existing buildings, make 2 or 3 more buildings on an extended road west or north of the town, and up the lootspawn inside the currently existing buildings inside tomato town. Right now, the houses just west of it give you 3x more loot than the whole town itself.",,
,,,"I agree, you can’t call 3 stores a town. ",,
,,,honestly i don't see a problem with current tomato town its a viable solos drop,,
,,,Yeah this looks great. It will also put more people in the top right of the map which can be kind of dead sometimes.,,
,,,Epic make this happen,,
,,,Yes yes yes. I love tomato and I'd love to see it turn into something glorious. ,,
,,,"This is a dope POI idea. I've always thought the area around tomato would be great to either expand or destroy tomato in order to create a big POI that would rival tilted. Either that area or take out the top part of moisty, move the prison a little south and build a big POI there",,
,,,I want this,,
,,,A pizza place and a gas station is hardly a town. Needs to revamped for sure. ,,
,,,when tomato town isnt a town but a pizza place with a taco shop gas station and ???,,
,,,Wait a minute isnt that the level from Hitman ,,
,,,I don’t even get why Tomato Town is a labelled place to go to. Literally 3 buildings. There’s better shit in those warehouses above Flush than this. ,,
,,,Called tomato “town” has 1 house,,
,,,"Nope, Tomato Town must remain the meme it is.",,
,,,Tony Tomato will be pleased,,
,,,"Make it like lucky landing x greasy grove

It might be a really cheesy combo but just wait until you get a pizza the saucy part.

Please don't ban me",,
,,,"The sad thing is, this is an amazing idea and we probably wont get to see it. Epic are fantastic with listening to the community but i just feel that this wont become a thing. ",,

*Pulls Out blue pump*

“Target Eliminated”",,
,,,Make Tomato Town great again!,,
,,,Isn’t that the beach map from Hitman.,,
,,,What a great idea tamato town does need a revamp i believe the concept of it being bigger with more houses and stores would make it  a new hotspot like tilted towers and dusty divot hopefully the epic sees this and actually does it,,
,,,"Ultimate hardcore tomato vegan iron-man btw here   
this devalues my account...",,
,,,More like tomato city.,,
,,,I am likely out of the loop but what does the con mean?,,
,,,I like the idea I'm just worried eventually the whole map will just be one big city,,
,,,"I dno why, but the left image seems to remind me of a map from MW3",,
,,,"wow, an actual good idea posted to this sub??? this would also help how dry it is after you leave anarchy when you drop there",,
,,,The fact that tomato town and the [wide] surrounding area has a max of 6 chests doesn't quite warrant a name right now. ,,
,,,"Gives me destiny island vibes
",,
,,,what exactly is a tomato town only account?,,
,,,Was expecting a picture of a crater,,
,,,This is a fantastic idea,,
,,,But what about my tomato town only ultimate Ironman???,,
,,,This is amazing. Support,,
,,,The mid game is so messed up because of tilted we really don't need this it'll just kill mid game,,
,,,Best idea I’ve seen in ages,,
,,,We can’t lose the house next to tomato town though.,,
,,,"u/hero
Tell us more. ",,
,,,Its rialto from overwatch!,,
,,,"I'm a tomato town account, I'm on the fence about this",,
,,,I really don't want them to do this. They already ruined my favorite place to drop (prison) so I'd rather they didn't change my second favourite place into tilted 2.,,
,,,Tomato town needs something. It’s very tiny with one large loot building and 3 single room buildings. Then the bridge and the outlying house and tunnel. It makes it a pain to drop there with the lack of loot. ,,
,,,This has got to be an epic shill account testing the Water... or at least I hope it is ,,
,,,"Tomato town is fine, ever since dusty was destroyed it's been my place to kill noobs.",,
,,,I'd be sad if Tomato Town got changed... It's one of my favorite places to drop. ,,

,,,A thousand times yes!,,

They could even include a marina like the one in [Monaco](http://nomadcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Monaco-residency-and-citizenship.jpg) with lootable mega yachts. And make that last part of the river from tomato to the shore wider and deeper. ",,

🍅 🍅 🍅 🍅 ",,

,,,This is brilliant!,,
,,,New tilted tomatoes confirmed ,,
,,,"That Tomato building in Tomato Town has always been a memorable part of this game, as it has been there in Save The World since like 2015, so if this could keep that building incorporated, I’m all for it. ",,

,,,Love it!!,,

,,,There should be a huge statue of the tomato man,,
,,,Yooo this is freaking dope.,,
,,,Gives me Just Cause 3 ptsd ,,
,,,"I just want another big drop spot on the east side of the map. West third has tilted, pleasant, greasy, snobby, shifty. On the east third retail is bigger/comparable to those but then what? Tomato and Moisty are eh (although Moisty has improved). Risky has a lot of chests but it’s still a small area. The jail has gotten worse since the new season. Anarchy, dusty, fatal, lucky are all kinda right down the middle. Redoing Tomato would help even out the map. ",,

jeez, fortnite players are so indecisive ",,

btw",,

Am i on /r/2007scape ?",,
