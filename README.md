# Sentiment Analysis
Final Year project

The user needs to add some search parameters before running the sentiment analysis

The subreddit name, search type and flair name are case sensitive and have to relevant to that subreddit.
All subreddits have top hot and new as a search type
But not all subreddits have the same flairs some even don’t have flairs
FortNiteBR subreddit (the one I’ve been using for testing) flairs include – SUGGESTION, HUMOUR, MEDIA  and many others. 
But you could use and any subreddit name if they have flairs to search.
 some others include

Subreddit Name	       /           Flairs

football	            /           Discussion, News, Opinion, Article, Question

computerscience	      /            Announcent, Discussion,Help,General

Iphone	               /           Question,Photo/Video
 

It is also necessary to have all librarys and modules used in the program.
